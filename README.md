# Anonimvote
The aim is to create anonymous vote. Somebody alway tries to hijack our retorspective votes, about what to discuss. And this is why I work on this tool.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.
